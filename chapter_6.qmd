# Data tidying

Let`s learn a consistent way to organize the data in R using a system called tidy data. Getting your data into this format requires some work up front, but that work pays off in the long term.

## Prerequisites

Weâ€™ll focus on `tidyr`, a package that provides a bunch of tools to help tidy up your messy datasets. `tidyr` is a member of the core `tidyverse`. We will use `pacman` package to manage the necessary packages for this chapter.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Tidy data

You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways. The example below shows the same data organized in three different ways. Each dataset shows the same values of four variables: country, year, population, and number of documented cases of TB (tuberculosis), but each dataset organizes the values in a different way.

There are three interrelated rules that make a dataset tidy:

- 1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
- 2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
- 3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="The following three rules make a dataset tidy: variables are columns, observations are rows, and values are cells"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/tidy_1.png')
```

- Why ensure that your data is tidy?

This is a consistent way of storing data. `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data.
